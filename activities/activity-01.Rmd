```{r}
URL <- "http://andrewpbray.github.io/data/LA.csv"
LA <- read.csv(URL)
```


```{r}

model <- lm(log(price) ~ log(sqft) + bed + city, data = LA) 
summary(model)
```

I think that the geometry of this model is like a plane. 

Seems like the reference level for city is compared to being located in Beverly Hills. 

The coefficient on bed appears to be slightly negative. This seems surprising because I thought that houses with more bedrooms would probably cost more money. Perhaps it is because, there are really expensive small downtown apartments.
