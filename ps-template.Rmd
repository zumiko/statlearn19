### Chapter 2 exercises

1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.
-Here, I think a flexible model is probably better than an inflexible. The large n relative to p means that we are unlikely to overfit the model based on a few outliers and are more likely to pick up an important trend. 

(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number
of observations n is small.
- Here, an inflexible model may be prefered since you run the risk of overfitting based on a limited amount of observation points. 

(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly
non-linear.
- Here, a more flexible model is likely necessary since a simple model would not account for the true relationship and the residuals would probably be bad. 

(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. Ïƒ2 = Var(), is extremely
high.
- In this case, it is probably best to use an inflexible model since with high variance you are more likely to overfit. 

2. Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide n and p.

(a) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each
firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the
CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors
affect CEO salary.
-Regression and inference. n = 500, p= 3 

(b) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know
whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20
similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price,
and ten other variables.
-Classification and prediction. n = 20, p = 13 

(c) We are interest in predicting the % change in the USD/Euro(c) We are interest in predicting the % change in the USD/Euroexchange rate in relation to the weekly changes in the world
stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For
each week we record the % change in the USD/Euro, the %
change in the US market, the % change in the British market,
and the % change in the German market.
-Regression and prediction. n = weeks in a yr ~52 p = 4 

4. You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.

(a) Describe three real-life applications in which classification might
be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the
goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your
answer.
- You could try to predict whether a booking reservation is fraud by the days ahead it is booked, the email server the reservation came from, the time it was booked, and where it was booked. This is prediction cause you only care if it is fraud or not. 
-You could try to infer things about people from different states by the way they talk, how they dress, how they recreate, and what they like to eat as regressors. This is more inference because youre curious how chracteristics correspond to home state.
- You could try to predict whether someone will graduate high school by their grades, their test scores, their household income. This is prediction because you're primarily interested in guessing the right outcome. 


(b) Describe three real-life applications in which regression might
be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the
goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your
answer.
- You could look at the effect of diet, exercise, and ethnicity on height. This is inference because you are curious how the predictors impact height. 
- You could look at the prices of houses using proximity to a school, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, crime in the area, closeness to a freeway, nearness to a park, and other factors. This is again inference because you are interested in the effect of the factors on a house's price. 
-You could try longevity based on diet, family history, medical history, social life, stress and other factors. Again, this is inference as you are curious to the effect of the regressors on the variable of interest. 

(c) Describe three real-life applications in which cluster analysis
might be useful.

5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus
a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what
circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less
flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?

6. Describe the differences between a parametric and a non-parametric
statistical learning approach. What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a nonparametric approach)? What are its disadvantages?
