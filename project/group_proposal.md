Group Proposal


1. Job board text analysis. Can we predict salary from job description? Predictive. Regression/Classification depending on whether we decide to coarsen the salary into bins. Use Kaggle or Indeed dataset with job_description text. 

Kaggle - response variable mined from the job description (they're strings and come in several formats--hourly, annual, etc.).
Indeed - restricts to the Data Scientist/Machine Learning job sub-field. The response variable is "queried salary" and is precategorized.

Maybe one of these,

2. Yelp text analysis. Can we predict the stars a reviewer gives from the sentiments expressed in the text review itself? Predictive. Classification. Kaggle Yelp dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset.

3. Speech analysis. Grab YouTube audio of news footage, horror clips, comedy, etc. use Praat for feature extraction, and predict which genre the audio comes from. Prediction and classification.
